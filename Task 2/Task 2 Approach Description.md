# **Task 2 Approach Description - Analysis & Insights**

Task 2 of the assessment focused on data analysis and visualisation. I had to work with `deal.csv` dataset which had multiple columns and required cleaning and prep before it could be used for visualisation. Therefore I chose to first create the datasets in BigQuery using SQL and then connect the output to Looker Studio.
